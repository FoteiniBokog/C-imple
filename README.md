C-imple is a small, educational, programming language.It is reminiscent of language C, from which it draws ideas and structures, but it is much smaller, both in supported structures and of course in programming capabilities.
This language contains many instructions used by popular programming languages. 
The C-imple supports structures such as the popular while and if‚Äêelse, as well as the original and interesting forcase and incase. 
It also supports functions and procedures, parameter transmission with reference and value, recursive calls. Allows nesting in the declaration of functions and procedures.
On the other hand, C-imple does not offer basic programming tools such as structure for or data types such as real numbers and strings or arrays.
These omissions simplify the process of building the compiler and has to do only with the reduction of the lines of code to be written, not with the difficulty of construction of the development process.
